# Room-Reserve-App-Project
## To create a web app to view buildings and available study rooms on the Berea campus

### Problem: 
*Currently at Berea College there are no means for students to remotely book study rooms or check the availability of such rooms in the academic buildings on campus. If a student yearns for a study area on campus they would need to be present physically in order to reserve that space. This, however, does not guarantee that a study space will be available as oftentimes students will traverse these academic buildings on campus to no avail.*

### Solution: 
*To solve this problem, an idea was drafted to create a web app interface, where students of the college can easily view the availability of study rooms and book them in various buildings across campus. This project will enable building administrators to manage and monitor room availability for students to have easy access to study spaces. Features of the web app will allow students to:*
- Select the academic building they wish to study in 
- To filter the academic rooms by availability.
- View the daily schedule of the study rooms within each academic building.
- View the capacity of each study room
- View the names of buildings and the room numbers
- The web app will also aid students to effortlessly reserve study spaces in academic buildings.

**PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process,
including how much your initial design plan evolved,
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results.
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*


6. **IMPLEMENTATIONS**
*Please briefly describe what was accomplished including
the largest challenges overcome and any innovations that were not
specifically required by the assignment.*


7. **TESTING**
*Please briefly describe your testing process.
Here you should be careful to select representative input cases,
including both representative typical cases as well as extreme cases.*

- My testing process included displaying the testing of the byte or bit on the screen to see if the method made the desrieed changes in memory. These tests were conducted in the main of the program.  

8. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

- None 

9. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

- I have learned greater knowledge of how error detection works and have had great deal of experience with a program that utilizes error detction mechanisms. The lab was a great introduction to these new concpts and also gave additional practice with using ADT. 


10. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*Please briefly describe ALL help you received and
all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references below.*
